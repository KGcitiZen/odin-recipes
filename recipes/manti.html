    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Homemade Manti, the pride of Turkish cuisine, are delectable traditional dumplings that offer a burst of flavors in every bite. These tiny parcels are typically filled with seasoned ground meat, such as lamb or beef, and wrapped in thinly rolled dough. Manti are carefully shaped into small, intricate pockets before being gently boiled or steamed to perfection</p>
    <p>Once cooked, they are adorned with a generous drizzle of garlic-infused yogurt and a sprinkling of sumac, adding tanginess and zest to the dish. Served with melted butter and a dash of paprika or red pepper flakes, Homemade Manti is a delightful combination of tender dumplings and a symphony of complementary tastes that will transport you straight to the heart of Turkish culinary heritage.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Dough:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon water, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Filling:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 onions, peeled</li>
      <li>½ pound ground beef</li>
      <li> salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Red Pepper Oil:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon red pepper flakes</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Yogurt Sauce:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) container plain yogurt</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Make dough: Combine flour and salt in a large bowl. Add eggs and water, mixing well with your hands. Add more water, if needed, to form a soft dough. Cover and set aside for at least 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>Make filling: Shred onions and place them in a colander or sieve set over a bowl; drain and discard juice. Combine drained onion, ground beef, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl; mix well with a spoon until mashed. Set filling aside.</li>
      <li>Lightly flour a work surface and a large plate.</li>
      <li>Divide dough in half. Working with one piece at a time, roll dough on the floured surface into a rectangle as thin as possible. Cut into 2-inch squares using a knife or pastry wheel.</li>
      <li>Place about 2 teaspoons filling in the center of each square. Gather the edges of dough and pinch them together at the top to form a bundle. Transfer manti to the prepared plate; sprinkle more flour on top to prevent sticking.</li>
      <li>Make oil: Heat oil and red pepper flakes in a small skillet over low heat just until pepper flakes begin to color oil. Remove from heat and keep warm.</li>
      <li>Make sauce: Stir together yogurt and garlic in a small bowl; set aside.</li>
      <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook manti in boiling water until filling is no longer pink and dough is tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Drain well.</li>
      <li>Divide manti onto 4 plates. Spoon yogurt sauce over manti and drizzle with pepper oil.</li>
    </ol>
